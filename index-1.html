<p>First network: Fractional Brownian Motion, 2-State Diffusion and CTRW</p>
<p>Second Network: Sub-diffusive, Brownian and Super-diffusive 
* Sub-diffusive: Hurst exponent &lt; 0.5
* Brownian: Hurst exponent = 0.5
* Super-diffusive: Hurst exponent &gt; 0.5</p>
<p>Simulations and models adapted to STORM(Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy) data.
Raw data is extracted from experimental observations, a pre-processing with ThunderSTORM and Jaqaman allows to obtain data localization and tracks reconstruction. 
Mongo DB is used to store experimental data, trained models and simulated data.
The development of a state-detection network is under consideration to analyze the diffusion coefficients for each state with a traditional approach or using neural networks.</p>
<p>Current accuracy for the first network is:</p>
